# Hello there 👋

My name is Mujtaba, and I am passionate about software development. I use this repository to document my progress and showcase some of the projects I have worked on.

## About Me
I have experience in C++, Python, and JavaScript, but I'm always looking to learn new languages and technologies. I believe that the best way to grow as a developer is to explore new tools and approaches, and to always be pushing the boundaries of what you know.
