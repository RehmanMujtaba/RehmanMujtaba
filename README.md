My name is Mujtaba. I have not had this repo for a long time, but I've started using it more recently to document my progress. 
I like looking at my older stuff and seeing how far I've come and how much better I can do now.

I'm interested in learning all sorts of new languages and technologies. I feel that now is the time to figure out what kind of 
devlopment I enjoy, rather than marry myself to one potential career path early on.

Competent in `C++`, `Python` and `JavaScript` \[to be continued\].
